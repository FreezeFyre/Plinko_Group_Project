# Plinko Simulation

This repository contains a simple Plinko game built with Python and `pygame`. Balls drop through a grid of pins and can be spawned with your mouse. The project is meant as a lightweight physics experiment and demo of the `pygame` library.

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.10 or newer
- **pygame** (tested with version 2.x)

Install dependencies with pip if needed:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Simulation

1. Navigate to the code directory:

```bash
cd "Plinko Project/Plinko Project"
```

2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

A window will open showing the Plinko board. The window can be resized and will maintain its original 3:4 aspect ratio. Click anywhere to spawn a new ball. Close the window or quit the program to stop the simulation.
